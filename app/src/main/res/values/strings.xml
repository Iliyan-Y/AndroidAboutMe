      The "Extract dimension resource" menu option is not available for this attribute, so you will have to add it to dimens.xml by hand.

If you want to start at this step, you can download this exercise code from: Step.03-Exercise-Add-ScrollView.

You will find plenty of //TODO comments to help you complete this exercise, and if you get stuck, go back and watch the video again.

Once you’re done, you can check your solution against the solution we’ve provided here: Step.03-Solution-Add-ScrollView or, using this git diff.
      Experiment with adding an ImageView above the TextView inside the ScrollView.
        \n\nWhen you run the app, this image, unlike the star, will scroll out of view as the text
        \n\nscrolls up.
\n\nHint: You will need to wrap the two scrollable views into a LinearLayout inside the ScrollView.
        \n\nScrollView > LinerLayout > ImageView + TextView
\n\nBelow is a skeleton code version for this challenge.
\n\nThe important thing to remember is that since ScrollView can only have one child,
        \n\nyou have to wrap that ImageView and the TextView into a LinearLayout.
\n\nThere is no solution code provided for this challenge, but the skeleton code below gives you the
        \n\nexpected view hierarchy to use.
